# Cookiecutter Project Template

## Overview
test_edit

This is a Cookiecutter project template designed to help you quickly set up a new data science or machine learning project with a standardized folder structure. By using this template, you can streamline the setup process for your projects and maintain consistency across multiple repositories.

The template includes predefined directories for data, notebooks, models, source code, tests, and configuration files, as well as a `Dockerfile` for containerization and a `.gitignore` file to manage which files should be ignored by version control.

## Folder Structure

When you create a new project using this template, the following folder structure will be generated:

- data/: Stores
    - raw
    - processed
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and experiments.
- models/: Folder to store saved models and related outputs.
- src/: Main source code for your project.
    - utils/: Utility scripts for preprocessing and other tasks.

- tests/: Unit tests and validation scripts for your project.
- configs/: Configuration files like YAML or JSON for model settings, hyperparameters, etc.
- logs/: Logs generated during the project execution.

README.md: Documentation for your project.<br>
requirements.txt: A list of Python dependencies.<br>
Dockerfile: Containerization setup for the project (if needed).<br>
.gitignore: Common files to be ignored by version control (e.g., logs, virtual environments, IDE files).

## How to Use This Template

### Step 1: Install Cookiecutter

If you haven't already, install Cookiecutter by running:

pip install cookiecutter

### Step 2: Create a New Repository

To create a new project based on this template, run the following command from your terminal:

cookiecutter ./cookiecutter-project-template

### Step 3: Input the Project Name

You will be prompted to enter the project name. This will replace the project_slug placeholder in the template, which will be used as the folder name for your new project. For example:

### Step 4: New Project is Generated

After entering the project name, a new folder will be created with the specified name, and all the necessary files and folder structure will be set up automatically. You will now see a new folder with the name you provided (e.g., `my_new_project`) in your current directory.

Inside this folder, the following structure will be created:

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the newly created project folder and install the project dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:

cd my_new_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
